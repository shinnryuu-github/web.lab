Before we can run the hotloader, we need to make sure that we actually navigate inside the folder first! To do so, we run
```
cd todo-react/
```
After that, we actually need to install some packages (like React!), to make this project run
```
npm install
```
Finally, we can then run the hotloader, which if you recall from past workshops, we do with the following
```
npm run hotloader
```
